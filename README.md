# charity_solana

This is an command line app which accesses my Solana wallet using the marvelous Orca SDK. 
It determines how much SOL I'm currently holding and prompts me to donate to specific charities.
If you want to make this app compatible with your wallet, you will need to delete the wallet.json and generate your own using the (official documentation)[https://orca-so.gitbook.io/orca-developer-portal/whirlpools/tour-de-whirlpool-tutorial/setting-up-your-environment].
